# Archive 
This repository serves as an archive for the thesis "Sensitivity of the Random Intercept Cross-lagged Panel Model to Unmodeled Measurement Error ". 

FETC case number: 22-1804.

All scripts were run with R version 4.1.1.

This archive is divided into two parts: 

1. An archive for the introduced sensRICLPM package (which is also available in its own repository here https://github.com/linakramerr/sensRICLPM).
2. An archive for the simulation study.
